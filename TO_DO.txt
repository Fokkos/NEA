Following
1)	- Profile has field called "follows", many to many relationship with itself that can link two users together (non-symmetrical)
	- Need to create button on user pages that adds the author of that blog post to the user's follows list
	- Have this button not appear if user is:
		a) not logged in
		b) the author of the post
	- And if the author of the post is already being followed, have the button unfollow the author instead
	- This should remove their name from the following list
	- Then be able to call upon this list to create:
		a) A friends list (ListView)
		b) custom feed index which shows posts only from who you are following

2)	- Custom feed index should only be loaded via the template if
		a) User is logged in
		b) User has more than 0 names in their follows list
	- Can just be added onto regular index template and set the conditionals to ensure the right template appears

Uploads
1)	- Make sure that filesizes are a sensible amount 
		a) 300*300px for pfps
		b) ~10MB for mp3s
		c) for music only accept ['mp3']
		d) for pfps only accept ['png','gif','jpg','jpeg'] (done with imageField)

2)	- Make audio files appear on posts where they are uploaded
		a) incl song name
		b) use <audio> tag for html5 player

Recommendations
1)	- Have recommendations be based on tags that user often listens to
	- In a ManyToOne field in the Profile, ensure that the user has a tally for each tag, and add to it each time a page is loaded which contains said tags
	- When loading a page, rng a number based on total tally of all tags and then search for 3 posts based on the tag that is subsequently generated
	- Then filter these posts as context for a template in base that will display them in a sidebar (near search) and provide links to them
	- Require user to be logged in to access this sidebar.
