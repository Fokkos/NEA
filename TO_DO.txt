Recommendations
1)	- Have recommendations be based on tags that user often listens to
	- In a ManyToOne field in the Profile, ensure that the user has a tally for each tag, and add to it each time a page is loaded which contains said tags
	- When loading a page, rng a number based on total tally of all tags and then search for 3 posts based on the tag that is subsequently generated
	- Then filter these posts as context for a template in base that will display them in a sidebar (near search) and provide links to them
	- Require user to be logged in to access this sidebar.
